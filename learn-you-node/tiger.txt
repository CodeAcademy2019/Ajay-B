The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognizable for its pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.
The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard. 
It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. 
It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support its prey requirements. 
This, coupled with the fact that it is indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
